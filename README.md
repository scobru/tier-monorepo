### Read-only functions

#### getSubscriptionStatus

````solidity
function ```solidity
getSubscriptionStatus(address _subscriber) external view returns (bool);
````

This function takes an address as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the subscriber with that address has a valid subscription. The validity of the subscription is determined by comparing the current block's timestamp to the subscription expiration timestamp stored for the subscriber.

#### fee

```solidity
function fee() external view returns (uint256);
```

This function returns the subscription fee amount required to subscribe to the service.

### Write functions

#### subscribe

```solidity
function subscribe() external payable;
```

This function allows a subscriber to subscribe to the service by sending a payment equal to the subscription fee to the contract. The function checks if the amount received is equal to the subscription fee and updates the subscriber's expiration timestamp to the current block's timestamp plus the duration of the subscription.
